Each project showcases my ability to clean, transform, and visualize data to extract meaningful insights that drive business value across different industries.

Throughout my work, I employ a systematic approach to data analysis: beginning with thorough data cleaning and transformation, followed by exploratory analysis to identify patterns and trends, then creating dynamic visualizations that communicate findings effectively, and finally documenting actionable insights that support business decision-making. My repository includes documentation of these methodologies alongside the code and visualizations to provide a complete picture of my analytical process.
